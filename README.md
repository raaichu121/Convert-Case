# **Convert-Case - A React-based Text Utility App**

Convert-Case is a simple, single-page React application that provides various text manipulation utilities. It allows users to perform common text transformations, analyze text properties, and get quick insights into their written content.
Features

    Uppercase Conversion: Convert all text to uppercase.

    Lowercase Conversion: Convert all text to lowercase.

    Alternating Case: Transform text into alternating uppercase and lowercase characters.

    Title Case: Capitalize the first letter of each word in the text.

    Wide Text Generator: Convert standard alphanumeric characters into their full-width (wide) Unicode equivalents.

    Zalgo Glitch Text Generator: Apply a "glitch" effect to text using Unicode combining characters (note: rendering may vary across browsers/systems).

    Unicode Bold Text Generator: Convert alphanumeric characters into their Unicode bold equivalents.

    Clear Text: Erase all text from the input area.

    Text Summary:

        Counts the number of words in the text.

        Counts the number of characters in the text.

        Estimates the reading time for the text.

    Live Preview: See the entered text in real-time in the preview section.

    Responsive Design: (Implied by Bootstrap usage, good to mention) The layout should adapt to different screen sizes.

Technologies Used

    React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

    Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first front-end web development (inferred from class names like btn, navbar, container).

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository (if applicable):

    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd text-utils-app # or whatever your project folder is named

    (If you don't have a repository, just ensure you have the src folder with App.js, TextForm.js, Navbar.js, and App.css in a React project created with create-react-app.)

    yarn install

    Run the Application:
    Start the development server:

    npm start

    This will open the application in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.

Usage

    Enter Text: Type or paste your desired text into the large text area.

    Apply Transformations: Click on any of the buttons (e.g., "Uppercase", "Alternating Case", "Zalgo Text") to apply the respective transformation to your text. The transformed text will appear directly in the input box.

    View Summary: Below the buttons, you'll find a summary showing the word count, character count, and estimated reading time of your current text.
